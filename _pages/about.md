I am a fifth-year PhD student at the School of Computer Science at Fudan University. My research interest includes Software Defined Networking, Programmable Data Plane and Network Measurement and Management. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang Xu](https://yangxu.info/) from School of Computer Science at Fudan University.

I served on the Program Committee for the SIGCOMM 2024 artifact evaluation.
