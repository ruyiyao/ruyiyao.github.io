I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, advised by [Prof. Yang Xu](https://yangxu.info/). My research focuses on networked systems, with an emphasis on data center networking. From July 2024 to July 2025, I was a visiting researcher at the National University of Singapore, collaborating with Prof. Chan Mun Choon. I am nearing completion of my Ph.D. studies and am actively seeking job opportunities.

I have contributed to the research community through program committee and reviewing service. I served on the CoNEXT 2025 Shadow Technical Program Committee and the SIGCOMM 2024 Artifact Evaluation Program Committee. I received a SIGCOMM 2024 travel grant and volunteered at SIGCOMM 2024, APNet 2024, and APNet 2025. In addition, I have acted as a reviewer for several conferences and journals, including ToN, INFOCOM, ICNP, CoNEXT, IWQoS, and JNCA.


Research Interests
======
- Programmable Data Plane
- Software Defined Networking
- Network Performance Optimization

My work spans flow-table storage and update optimization, packet classification, programmable packet scheduling architectures, and mechanisms for congestion control, load balancing, and routing.
