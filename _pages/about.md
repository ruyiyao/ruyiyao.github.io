I am a sixth-year PhD student at the School of Computer Science at Fudan University. My research interest includes Software Defined Networking, Programmable Data Plane and Network Performance Optimization. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang Xu](https://yangxu.info/) at Fudan University.  From July 2024 to July 2025, I was a visiting student at the National University of Singapore, working with Prof. Chan Mun Choon. I am approaching graduation and actively seeking job opportunities.

I served as a Shadow TPC member for CoNEXT 2025 and was also a PC member for the SIGCOMM 2024 Artifact Evaluation. I received a SIGCOMM 2024 travel grant and volunteered at SIGCOMM 2024, APNet 2024, and APNet 2025. I have also served as a reviewer for several conferences and journals, including INFOCOM, ICNP, IWQoS, and JNCA.
