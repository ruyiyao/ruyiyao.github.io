The future network is expected to support extremely large bandwidth, ultra-low latency or deterministic delay, extremely high reliability, and massive connectivity for novel forward-looking scenarios. As one of the most fundamental parts of the network, routing plays a vital role in a well-performed network. Recently, some new techniques using machine intelligence to optimize the network routing have been proposed. Although they have demonstrated great potential to improve the network performance, it is still a great challenge to apply machine intelligence-based routing in real network environment due to the limitations of current network architectures and protocols. Fortunately, the future network research program is on-going for designing new network paradigms, which provides an opportunity to address those limitations. In this paper, we investigate state-of-the-art techniques in machine intelligence-enabled network routing and discuss the development trends of machine intelligence-enabled routing optimization techniques for the future network.
